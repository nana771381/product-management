# product-management

first ever group project for our oop assignment (a simple java project)

There are 7 features:

    1 -- Display Products
    
    2 -- Add Products
    
    3 -- Delete Products
    
    4 -- Discontinue Products (It means I have stocks but not for sale)
    
    5 -- Add Stocks
    
    6 -- Delete Stocks
    
    7 -- Exit
    
 It was very challenging for us at first. We got a month or so (or even more time) to complete this project, yet we rushed it in the last week. After that, our final exam was to create a similar project but individual, in a day. It did got easy after knowing the structure of it I guess. Nice experience.
